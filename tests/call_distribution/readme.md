Goal: select distribution to use to parameterize calling rates

Contents:
- `choose_call_dist.R` follows a blog post to fit several probability distributions to Franklin's call rate data
- `detection_sim.R` contains model functions modified to use different call rate distributions
- `run_detection_sim.R` simple demo of how to run model and compare results using different call rate distributions
